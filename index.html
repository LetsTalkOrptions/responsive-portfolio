      <p>
          My name is James, I am a 23 year old financial trader employed by LPL Financial in Charlotte, NC. I am originally from Schuylkill
          Haven, PA and moved south when I was 17. I grew up a golfer, playing in multiple events for Team USA and
          competing all around the world.
      </p>

      <p>
          I am taking the Full-Stack Web Development Course through UNC  Charlotte to give me a fundamental understanding of how coding
          software operates and eventually be able to tie it into my career as a financial trader. I plan to learn
          algorithmic trading after this course and tie it into the technical analysis skills I have developed as a
          trader. Feel free to check out my site and send me a message anytime! Cheers!
